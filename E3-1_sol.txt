no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Cueing down from goal distance:   11 into depth [1]
                                  10            [1][2]
                                   9            [1][2]
                                   8            [1] --- pruning stopped --- [1][2][3][4][5]

Enforced Hill-climbing failed !
switching to Best-first Search now.
